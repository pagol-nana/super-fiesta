Figure Skating is set to crown its world champions for the post-Olympic season.

The ISU World Figure Skating Championships are being held 22-26 March at the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan, on the outskirts of Tokyo - returning to the site of Worlds from 2014 and 2019.

Japan's Uno Shoma (men) and Sakamoto Kaori (women) are the reigning world champions in singles, while Americans Alexa Knierim and Brandon Frazier won the U.S. its first-ever world title in pairs in 2022.

Ice dance is guaranteed a first-time world champion team, with reigning Olympic and world champions Gabrielle Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron sitting out this season.

Veteran ice dance teams Madison Chock and Evan Bates of the U.S. and Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier (among other teams) lead the race for the ice dance title, while the Japanese duo of Miura Riku and Kihara Ryuichi aim to become the first from their country to win a world title in pairs.

U.S. champions Ilia Malinin and Isabeau Levito - both teenagers - are eyeing strong showings in singles, as well, Malinin armed with his historic quadruple Axel. Sakamoto will be challenged by Japanese teammate Mihara Mai, who swept her Grand Prix stops in the first half of the season - including the exclusive Grand Prix Final.
